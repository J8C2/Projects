Files I constructed and did for school projects with outside resources and implementations. Done in Java

Project 4: Constructed a specified ethereum block chain as well as making transactions to each of these. Manipulated and used unique defining methods to help give unique solutions. 

Project 5: Used JavaFX / ChartFree Library to implement 3 different types of graphs (bar, line, pie) to display data and to vastly manipulate them when needed.
